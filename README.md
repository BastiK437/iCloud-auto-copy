# iCloud-auto-copy

Python script to automatically copy all pictures from the iCloud sync directory to another directory.
This is necessary because iCloud is such a great tool on Windows and there is no option to download the synced 
files completely. Instead it only downloads the preview pictures and it needs to fully download the picture if you 
want to view it. On a diashow or generally if you want to work with the files its suuuper annoying to do so. 

So this script copies all new files in an "offline" directory. The copy process automatically downloads all files completely.
